HOW TO RUN
==========

First, install Yarn. If you are on macOS or Linux you can install Yarn directly from a package manager. On macOS, this requires [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and the command is `brew install yarn`. Windows users: install [this MSI](https://yarnpkg.com/latest.msi).

Now clone this repository and `cd` to it in a terminal. Run these commands:

* `yarn`
  * This should install all dependencies. It may take a while. You will need an internet connection for this.
* `yarn start`
  * This should run the server and give you a URL to access in your browser.
* Open and edit `src/App.js`
 Â * As you edit the file the server should recompile automatically.

This project uses React but only mildly! You should be fine even if you have no prior React experience. All we will need for the interview is screen-sharing, a text editor, and a cautious optimism about JavaScript as a modern language.
